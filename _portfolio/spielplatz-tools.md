Spielplatz Tools

Artist Emanuel Mooner focuses on ancient tools and their history, such as keys, shovels, axes, etc. These basic instruments used by humas for centuries are manipulated or artistically changed, so they can´t be used anymore.
This series of tools is designed for children.
Mooner´s sense of sustainability alarmed him, when he saw, most children use plastic or one-time-use toys.
For the heavy use on playgrounds, he sampled the classic aluminium shovel and turned it into a design object that is strong enough for many days of use.
