Spielplatz Tools

Artist Emanuel Mooner focuses on ancient tools, their history, and their symbolism.

These basic instruments are manipulated or artistically changed, so they can´t be used anymore in their original sense.

Barbiewire is a mix of two words: Barbwire and Barbie.
The use of Barbwire is mostly military. The lavender colored coating transforms it into a un-manly, un-usable tool.
This work was Mooner´s first public response to the russian-ukrainian conflict in February 2022.
